# The is the 2nd Project for React Programming via Udacity. 

This repo for the Would You Like Project -  [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

This project consists of using React with Redux where questions are created, a leaderboard is used, users are logged and authenticated, summary of all the registered users
It covers actions, reducers, middleware,apis and uses a _DATA.js source file. 



The application consists of several pages which are shown below. 

  1. [THE LOGIN PAGE ] : The login page uses a form and asks the user for a login before authenticating them and moving to the rest of the application.

 Errors Found and Changes made after Submission 1

 1. â€‹ Error 1 
function Routes(props) {
  return <div className="container">
    <Switch>
      {
        props.notLoggedIn ? <Route path='/' exact component={Login}/> :
          <Fragment>
            <Route path='/' exact component={Dashboard} />
            <Route path='/leaderboard' exact component={LeaderBoard} />
            <Route path='/add' component={NewQuestion}/>
            <Route path="/questions/:id" component={QuestionDetails} />
            <Route exact path='/logout' component={Logout} />
          </Fragment>
      }
      <Route component={NotFound} />
REQUIRED
When a user is not logged in, they should be routed to the login page before determining if the page is a 404 or not. Please checkout this tutorial: tylermcginnis.com/react-router-protected-routes-authentication/

Changed to 

function Routes(props) {
  return <div className="container">
    <Switch>
      {
        props.notLoggedIn ? <Route path='/' exact component={Login}/> :
          <Fragment>
            <Route path='/' exact component={Dashboard} />
            <Route path='/leaderboard' exact component={LeaderBoard} />
            <Route path='/add' component={NewQuestion}/>
            <Route path="/questions/:id" component={QuestionDetails} />
            <Route exact path='/logout' component={Logout} />
            <Route component={NotFound} />
          </Fragment>
      }
    <Route path='/' exact component={Login}/>

2. Changed from notlogged in variables to isloggedIn variables
SUGGESTION
when naming variables, its best to use positive names, such as isLoggedIn, and use the !isLoggedIn for "not"

3. The code runs without errors. There are no warnings that resulted from not following the best practices listed in the documentation, such as using key for list items. All code is functional and formatted properly.

Submission 2 -

Error 1 - If a logged out user tries to access a page like http://localhost:3000/add this that only logged in users can see, you must redirect for the login page.

Also, when the user tries to access a page that doesn't exist, the user must be redirected to a 404 (Not Found) Page.

On both cases, I was redirected to the page below:

Submission 3 - 

Crazy I did not fix these bugs as I thought I did. :-(

Made some changes
1. Tested pages so no 404 error appears on all screens. See image below
<img src="https://github.com/genedarocha/wouldyourather-Project2/blob/master/public/images/wur_no404.png" height="250"/>

2. Test pages, if you put localhost:3000/add so that it points to error and a click takes you back to main page.

3. Test pages, if you put localhost:3000/addxx so that it points to error and a click takes you back to main page.

There is a warning message that shows up in the console right after logging in and landing on the dashboard. This probably is due to conditional rendering of routes. 

4. Fixed the routing so that there no warning from a controlled to a unctrolled prop and associated errors

5. Created xport default function connectRoute(WrappedComponent) { under file connectRoute.js and following constants 
const LoginWrapper = connectRoute(Login);
const DashboardWrapper = connectRoute(Dashboard);
const LeaderboardWrapper  = connectRoute(LeaderBoard);
const NewQuestionWrapper = connectRoute(NewQuestion);
const QuestionDetailsWrapper = connectRoute(QuestionDetails);
const LogoutWrapper = connectRoute(Logout);

Used -             <Route path='/' exact component={DashboardWrapper} /> as part of the calling, but still get the errors on login and logging out - index.js:1 Warning: <Route> elements should not change from uncontrolled to controlled (or vice versa). You initially used no "location" prop and then provided one on a subsequent render.

6. Made change to - const { id } = match.params.id; 
7. Made Change - To have access to React Router match props, passed in the props here. Something like this:
<Route path="/questions/:id" component={({match}) => ( <WithUser isLoggedIn={isLoggedIn}> <QuestionDetailsWrapper match={match} /> </Wit......
8. Had a new problem when you came to vote, which would cause another problem. Fixed the issue, by passing in {match} and then using id to from match not props.id.. Fixed

 function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch, {match}) {
//  const { id } = props.match.params.id;
    const { id } = match.params;
