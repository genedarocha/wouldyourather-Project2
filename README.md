 1. â€‹ Error 1 
function Routes(props) {
  return <div className="container">
    <Switch>
      {
        props.notLoggedIn ? <Route path='/' exact component={Login}/> :
          <Fragment>
            <Route path='/' exact component={Dashboard} />
            <Route path='/leaderboard' exact component={LeaderBoard} />

            <Route path="/questions/:id" component={QuestionDetails} />
            <Route exact path='/logout' component={Logout} />
          </Fragment>
      }
      <Route component={NotFound} />
REQUIRED
When a user is not logged in, they should be routed to the login page before determining if the page is a 404 or not. Please checkout this tutorial: tylermcginnis.com/react-router-protected-routes-authentication/

Changed to 

function Routes(props) {
  return <div className="container">
    <Switch>
      {
        props.notLoggedIn ? <Route path='/' exact component={Login}/> :
          <Fragment>
            <Route path='/' exact component={Dashboard} />
            <Route path='/leaderboard' exact component={LeaderBoard} />
            <Route path='/add' component={NewQuestion}/>
            <Route path="/questions/:id" component={QuestionDetails} />
            <Route exact path='/logout' component={Logout} />
            <Route component={NotFound} />
          </Fragment>
      }
    <Route path='/' exact component={Login}/>

2. Changed from notlogged in variables to isloggedIn variables
SUGGESTION
when naming variables, its best to use positive names, such as isLoggedIn, and use the !isLoggedIn for "not"

3. The code runs without errors. There are no warnings that resulted from not following the best practices listed in the documentation, such as using key for list items. All code is functional and formatted properly.

to be evaluated in the next review


Submission 2 -

Error 1 - If a logged out user tries to access a page like http://localhost:3000/add this that only logged in users can see, you must redirect for the login page.

Also, when the user tries to access a page that doesn't exist, the user must be redirected to a 404 (Not Found) Page.

On both cases, I was redirected to the page below:
